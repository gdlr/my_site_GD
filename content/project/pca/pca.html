<h2>Exploring relationships between countries’ environmental variables</h2>
<p>On a global scale, countries vary in many environmental factors, such as temperature, precipitation, and elevation. To explore correlations between nine different environmental variables, I performed a Principal Component Analysis on a dataset of environmental values by country compiled from the <a href="https://earthengine.google.com/">Google Earth Engine</a> by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/zanderventer/environmental-variables-for-world-countries">Zander Venter</a>. These data are non-normalized summary statistics calculated from remote sensing data.</p>

#Maybe wind isn&#39;t a great variable to use...55 missings. The others have just a few missing values. Tree canopy cover has 11, but I&#39;ll keep it. To run PCA, you can&#39;t have any NA&#39;s, and I&#39;d rather not have a wind variable than remove 11 full countries&#39; data.

# I&#39;m going to pare the data down to first reduce redundancy (like mean rainfall, max quarterly rainfall) and to select just a few environmental varaibles that I think might be correlated. 

# I&#39;ve chosen elevation, aspect, slope, cropland cover, tree cover, isothermality (how variable a country&#39;s yearly temperature fluxuations are), annual rainfall, annual temperature, and number of cloudy days.

<p>A principal component analysis reveals a few revealing correlations:</p>
<ul>
<li>annual mean temperature is strongly negatively correlated with elevation</li>
<li>the percentage of a country covered by cropland is negatively correlated with isothermality</li>
<li>cloudiness, tree canopy cover, and mean rainfall are positively correlated</li>
<li>elevation and cropland cover are somewhat positively correlated</li>
</ul>
<p>Though interesting, these data are somewhat problematic: country size varies greatly on a global scale, and environmental conditions vary widely within larger countries. Binning countries by size or breaking down larger countries into smaller regions may better elucidate correlations between other variables.</p>
