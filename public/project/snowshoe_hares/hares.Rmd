## Exploring Snowshoe Hare population in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest

Snowshoe Hares are a keystone prey species in boreal forests. Snowshoe hare population density influences the ecosystem in both bottom-up and top-down ways: hare population density is linked to both vegetation abundance and predator abundance (Stenseth et al, 1997). Here, snowshoe hare weights and population density are compared through time. 

Data were obtained from the [Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest Long Term Ecological Research Program](https://portal.lternet.edu/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-bnz.55.22).

![**Fig. 1** *Density plot showing snowshoe hare weight distrubutions per year, from 1998 to 2012 (left plot). Second plot shows total counted hares per year (right plot).*](/img/wt_fig.png)

Weight distrubution for adult snowshoe hares remained relatively stable between 1998 and 2012 (Fig 1). High density of low-weight hares, likely indicating a juvenile-skewed demogaphic, often preceeded population rebounds (eg. in 2002 and 2003). However, a low-weight population in 1999 actually preceeded a significant population decline. Cyclic hare growth is characteristic of the predator-prey interaction model, where periods of high prey growth are followed by significant predator population increases, which then cause prey population decline. 

```{r make a table}

# Let's make a table of mean weights per year, with standard deviations and hare counts per year

# First, select and summarize our data so it will look nice in a table

hare_table <- weight_yr %>% 
  select(-date) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(mean = round(mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
            stdev = round(sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
            n = n())

# And then make a table using kableExtra

hare_table <- kable(hare_table,
      col.names = c("Year", "Mean (g)", "Standard Deviation", "Number of Observations"))%>%
      kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped"),
                    full_width = F) %>%
      add_header_above(header = c("Average Yearly Hare Weights" = 4)) %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "200px")


```

`r hare_table`
